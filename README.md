This is a music player web app 
Because every moment feels better with Christmas music,
I turned that inspiration into a project a mini web-based 
music player designed exclusively for Christmas songs.
This project allowed me to explore UI/UX, audio handling,
responsive design, and seasonal-themed interfaces.
Excited to share a small build filled with creativity, learning, and holiday spirit!
